# GA4GH Pedigree Standard

The GA4GH Pedigree Standard allows for the computable exchange of family health history as well as representation of larger, more complex families. The collection of specific clinical or genetic data is outside the scope of this deliverable, and would instead be handled by other formats and references to individuals within the pedigree representation. Standardizing the way systems represent family structure will allow patients to share this information more easily between healthcare systems and help software tools use this information to improve genome analysis and diagnosis.

This has been developed as part of the [GA4GH Clinical Phenotype Data Capture Workstream](https://ga4gh-cp.github.io/).
